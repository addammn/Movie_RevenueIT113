# 🎬 Movie_IT113 — Two Model Revenue Prediction

This project is for our ITI113 Machine Learning & Operations module.  
The goal is simple: **predict movie revenue** using two different models and compare them.

---

## 🚀 What we built
- **Model A (Baseline):** Linear Regression  
- **Model B (Stronger):** Random Forest Regressor  
- Both models are trained on a movie dataset (budget, runtime, popularity, genre, etc.) and predict revenue (in millions USD).

## 📂 Project files
- `Two_Models_Training_Colab_Drive.ipynb` → Run in **Google Colab** (auto-mounts Google Drive).  
- `movie_boxoffice.csv` → A demo dataset (realistic, small).  
- `artifacts/` → Saved models + metrics after training.
- `streamlit_app.py` → Simple web app (shows predictions from both models).  
- `requirements.txt` → Packages needed.
